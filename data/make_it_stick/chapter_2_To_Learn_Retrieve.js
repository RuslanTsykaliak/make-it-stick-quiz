        "question": "What is the 'testing effect,' also known as the 'retrieval-practice effect'?",
        "options": [
            "The stress students feel when being graded, which enhances focus.",
            "The act of retrieving knowledge from memory makes that knowledge stick better than re-exposing yourself to the original material.",
            "The finding that students test better on material they find interesting.",
            "The way a single test can accurately measure a student's total knowledge."
        ],
        "answer": "The act of retrieving knowledge from memory makes that knowledge stick better than re-exposing yourself to the original material.",
        "explanation": "Practicing retrieval makes learning stick far better than reexposure to the original material does. This is the testing effect, also known as the retrieval-practice effect."

    {
        "question": "According to the chapter, how is reflection described as a form of practice?",
        "options": [
            "By passively thinking about a topic without any specific goal.",
            "By retrieving knowledge from memory, connecting it to new experiences, and mentally rehearsing what you might do differently.",
            "By discussing a topic with peers to get different opinions.",
            "By rereading notes slowly and carefully at the end of the day."
        ],
        "answer": "By retrieving knowledge from memory, connecting it to new experiences, and mentally rehearsing what you might do differently.",
        "explanation": "Reflection can involve several cognitive activities that lead to stronger learning: retrieving knowledge and earlier training from memory, connecting these to new experiences, and visualizing and mentally rehearsing what you might do differently next time."

        "question": "When is retrieval practice most potent for reinforcing retention?",
        "options": [
            "When it's easy and retrieval is immediate.",
            "When it's done only once, right before an exam.",
            "When retrieval is effortful and delayed, allowing some forgetting to occur.",
            "When the answers are provided alongside the questions."
        ],
        "answer": "When retrieval is effortful and delayed, allowing some forgetting to occur.",
        "explanation": "After an initial test, delaying subsequent retrieval practice is more potent for reinforcing retention than immediate practice, because delayed retrieval requires more effort. The greater the effort to retrieve learning, provided that you succeed, the more that learning is strengthened."

            "The finding that learning is stronger when new ideas are generated by a teacher.",
            "The fact that memory is strengthened when the learner makes the effort to generate an answer, like filling in a blank, rather than just reading it.",
            "A classroom technique where students generate their own test questions."
        ],
        "answer": "The fact that memory is strengthened when the learner makes the effort to generate an answer, like filling in a blank, rather than just reading it.",
        "explanation": "Simply asking a subject to fill in a word’s missing letters resulted in better memory of the word. This experiment was a demonstration of what researchers call the 'generation effect'."

        "question": "In the Columbia Middle School study, how did students' scores on quizzed material compare to their scores on material that was only reviewed?",
        "options": [
            "The scores were roughly the same for both.",
            "They scored slightly lower on the quizzed material due to test anxiety.",
            "They scored a full grade level higher (e.g., A- vs. C+) on the quizzed material.",
            "The reviewed material was remembered better because it was seen more times."
        ],
        "answer": "They scored a full grade level higher (e.g., A- vs. C+) on the quizzed material.",
        "explanation": "The eighth graders averaged 79 percent (C+) on the science material that had not been quizzed, compared to 92 percent (A−) on the material that had been quizzed."

        "question": "What effect does providing corrective feedback after a test have on learning?",
        "options": [
            "It has little to no effect on long-term retention.",
            "It strengthens retention more than testing alone does.",
            "It often confuses students and leads to incorrect learning.",
            "It is only helpful if the feedback is given instantly."
        ],
        "answer": "It strengthens retention more than testing alone does.",
        "explanation": "Studies show that giving feedback strengthens retention more than testing alone does. Giving students corrective feedback after tests keeps them from incorrectly retaining material they have misunderstood."

    {
        "question": "In general, which type of test appears to be MORE effective for long-term learning?",
        "options": [
            "Multiple choice or true/false tests.",
            "Tests that require you to supply the answer, like an essay or short-answer test.",
            "Open-book tests where you can see the material.",
            "Group tests where students can collaborate on the answers."
        ],
        "answer": "Tests that require you to supply the answer, like an essay or short-answer test.",
        "explanation": "Tests that require the learner to supply the answer, like an essay or short-answer test, or simply practice with flashcards, appear to be more effective than simple recognition tests like multiple choice or true/false tests."

            "The cramming group forgot 50% of the material after two days, while the retrieval group forgot only 13%.",
            "The retrieval group forgot information much faster than the cramming group.",
            "Cramming led to zero forgetting after two days."
        ],
        "answer": "The cramming group forgot 50% of the material after two days, while the retrieval group forgot only 13%.",
        "explanation": "In a second test two days after an initial test, the crammers had forgotten 50 percent of what they had been able to recall on the initial test, while those who had spent the same period practicing retrieval...had forgotten only 13 percent."

        "question": "What is an indirect benefit of frequent, low-stakes classroom quizzing?",
        "options": [
            "It reduces the total amount of material a student needs to learn.",
            "It eliminates the need for homework.",
            "It is less work for the teacher than creating a midterm.",

        "question": "What happens in the brain when you successfully retrieve a memory?",
        "options": [
            "The memory is permanently locked and cannot be changed.",
            "The memory is slightly weakened with each retrieval.",
            "The brain reconsolidates the memory, strengthening its connections to what you already know.",
            "A completely new memory trace is created, erasing the old one."
        ],
        "answer": "The brain reconsolidates the memory, strengthening its connections to what you already know.",
        "explanation": "Recalling what you have learned causes your brain to reconsolidate the memory, which strengthens its connections to what you already know and makes it easier for you to recall in the future."

            "They feel the classes are easier but less informative."
        ],
        "answer": "They rate their classes more favorably.",
        "explanation": "In all studies of testing that reported students’ attitudes, the students who were tested frequently rated their classes more favorably at the end of the semester than those tested less frequently."

            "They avoid it entirely in favor of rereading."
        ],
        "answer": "Mainly to discover what they don’t know so they can study that material more.",
        "explanation": "Even when they did report testing themselves, they mostly said they did it to discover what they didn’t know, so they could study that material more. Few students realize that retrieval itself creates greater retention."

        "options": [
            "It has no effect on knowledge transfer.",
            "It hinders transfer because it focuses only on rote memorization.",
            "It can facilitate better transfer of knowledge compared to rereading.",
            "It only helps with transfer if the new context is identical to the old one."
        ],
        "answer": "It can facilitate better transfer of knowledge compared to rereading.",
        "explanation": "Research indicates that testing, compared to rereading, can facilitate better transfer of knowledge to new contexts and problems."

        "question": "What is the primary reason that spaced-out retrieval practice is more effective than massed practice?",
        "options": [
            "It feels easier and builds confidence quickly.",
            "It allows some forgetting to set in, which requires more effort to reconstruct the learning, thus strengthening it.",

            "It relies on short-term memory, which is faster."
        ],
        "answer": "It allows some forgetting to set in, which requires more effort to reconstruct the learning, thus strengthening it.",
        "explanation": "When retrieval practice is spaced, allowing some forgetting to occur between tests, it leads to stronger long-term retention than when it is massed. The greater the effort to retrieve learning...the more that learning is strengthened."
