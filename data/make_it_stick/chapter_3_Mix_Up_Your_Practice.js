    "question": "What is the common term for the single-minded, repetitive practice of one thing at a time until it's mastered?",
    "options": [
      "Spaced Practice",
      "Interleaved Practice",
      "Massed Practice",
      "Varied Practice"
    ],
    "answer": "Massed Practice",
    "explanation": "Researchers call the single-minded, rapid-fire repetition of something 'massed' practice. It's the 'practice-practice-practice' of conventional wisdom."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does massed practice often feel like a very effective learning strategy?",
    "options": [
      "It leads to the best long-term retention.",
      "It produces rapid, visible gains in performance during the practice session.",
      "It requires the most cognitive effort.",
      "It is the method preferred by all expert performers."
    ],
    "answer": "It produces rapid, visible gains in performance during the practice session.",
    "explanation": "Faith in focused, repetitive practice is pervasive because most of us see fast gains during the learning phase of massed practice, which reinforces the feeling of productivity."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary drawback of the rapid gains achieved during massed practice?",
    "options": [
      "The gains are often transitory and the knowledge is forgotten quickly.",
      "It takes too long to see any improvement.",
      "It only works for learning physical skills.",
      "It can lead to overthinking and anxiety."
    ],
    "answer": "The gains are often transitory and the knowledge is forgotten quickly.",
    "explanation": "The rapid gains produced by massed practice are often evident, but the rapid forgetting that follows is not. The learning is not durable."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'spaced practice'?",
    "options": [
      "Studying in a large, open space.",
      "Practicing one topic for a very long, single session.",
      "Breaking up practice into separate sessions that are spaced out over time.",
      "Quickly moving from one topic to another with no breaks."
    ],
    "answer": "Breaking up practice into separate sessions that are spaced out over time.",
    "explanation": "Practice is far more effective when it’s broken into separate periods of training that are spaced out, allowing time for consolidation and a little forgetting."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is spaced practice more effective than massed practice for long-term retention?",
    "options": [
      "It feels easier and builds confidence more quickly.",
      "It relies entirely on short-term memory.",
      "It requires effort to retrieve the learning after some forgetting has occurred, which strengthens the memory.",
      "It ensures that you never make a mistake during practice."
    ],
    "answer": "It requires effort to retrieve the learning after some forgetting has occurred, which strengthens the memory.",
    "explanation": "The increased effort required to retrieve the learning after a little forgetting has the effect of retriggering consolidation, further strengthening memory."

    "question": "In the study of surgical residents learning microsurgery, which group performed significantly better a month later?",
    "options": [
      "The group whose four lessons were massed into a single day.",
      "The group whose four lessons were spaced a week apart.",
      "Both groups performed equally well.",
      "The group that watched videos instead of practicing."
    ],
    "answer": "The group whose four lessons were spaced a week apart.",
    "explanation": "In a test given a month after their last session, those whose lessons had been spaced a week apart outperformed their colleagues in all areas, including time, movements, and success rate."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'interleaved practice'?",
    "options": [
      "Studying one topic completely before moving to the next.",
      "Mixing the practice of two or more different subjects or skills within a single study session.",
      "Practicing with a partner and taking turns.",
      "Reviewing notes between practice attempts."
    ],
    "answer": "Mixing the practice of two or more different subjects or skills within a single study session.",
    "explanation": "Interleaving the practice of two or more subjects or skills is a more potent alternative to massed practice. You switch before each practice is complete."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the study where students learned to find the volumes of geometric solids, what was the surprising outcome?",
    "options": [
      "The massed practice group did better on both practice and the final test.",
      "Both groups performed poorly on the final test.",
      "The interleaved group did worse during practice but scored over 200% better on the final test.",
      "The interleaved group did better on practice but worse on the final test."
    ],
    "answer": "The interleaved group did worse during practice but scored over 200% better on the final test.",
    "explanation": "During practice, the massed group averaged 89% correct vs. 60% for the interleaved group. But on the final test a week later, the massed group averaged only 20% while the interleaved group averaged 63%."

  {
    "question": "What was the result of the study where eight-year-olds practiced tossing beanbags into buckets?",
    "options": [
      "The kids who only practiced at 3 feet were the best at the 3-foot toss.",
      "Practicing at different distances had no effect on the final test.",
      "The kids who practiced at 2 and 4 feet did better on a 3-foot toss than kids who only ever practiced at 3 feet.",
      "All the children became frustrated and their performance declined."
    ],
    "answer": "The kids who practiced at 2 and 4 feet did better on a 3-foot toss than kids who only ever practiced at 3 feet.",
    "explanation": "The beanbag study demonstrated varied practice. The kids who did the best were those who’d practiced on two- and four-foot buckets but never on three-foot buckets, developing a more flexible skill."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a significant advantage of both interleaving and varied practice?",
    "options": [
      "They make learning feel easier and faster.",
      "They help learners learn to discriminate between different types of problems and choose the correct solution.",
      "They eliminate the need for any corrective feedback.",
      "They guarantee perfect performance during the initial practice."
    ],
    "answer": "They help learners learn to discriminate between different types of problems and choose the correct solution.",
    "explanation": "A significant advantage of interleaving and variation is that they help us learn better how to assess context and discriminate between problems, selecting and applying the correct solution from a range of possibilities."

      "The commonalities within a single painter's work.",
      "The differences between the works of multiple painters.",
      "The monetary value of the paintings."
    ],
    "answer": "The differences between the works of multiple painters.",
    "explanation": "The commonalities learned through massed practice proved less useful than the differences between the works of multiple painters that the students learned through interleaving."
  },
  {
    "question": "Even after seeing that interleaving led to better test scores, what did the students in the painting study believe?",
    "options": [
      "They immediately adopted interleaving as their preferred method.",
      "They became confused and couldn't remember which method they used.",
      "They were indifferent to which method was used.",
      "They persisted in believing that massed practice was a better strategy for them."
    ],
    "answer": "They persisted in believing that massed practice was a better strategy for them.",
    "explanation": "The myths of massed practice are hard to exorcise, even when you’re experiencing the evidence yourself. They clung to their belief that concentrated viewing was better."

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between 'momentary strength' and 'underlying habit strength'?",
    "options": [
      "Momentary strength is for mental skills, habit strength is for physical skills.",
      "Momentary strength is the visible improvement during practice, while habit strength is the durable, long-term learning.",
      "Momentary strength is weak, while habit strength is powerful.",
      "There is no difference; they are the same thing."
    ],
    "answer": "Momentary strength is the visible improvement during practice, while habit strength is the durable, long-term learning.",
    "explanation": "Scientists call heightened performance during the acquisition phase 'momentary strength' and distinguish it from 'underlying habit strength.' The techniques that build habit strength, like spacing, slow visible acquisition."

  {
    "question": "What is the recommended time interval for spacing practice sessions?",
    "options": [
      "Exactly 24 hours.",
      "No more than 5 minutes.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'blocked practice,' and why is it a potential trap in learning?",
    "options": [
      "It's when a learner is blocked from practicing and cannot improve.",
      "It's the most effective form of practice for building versatile skills.",
      "It's practicing a sequence of different skills in the same order every time, which doesn't build versatility.",
      "It's a method where the teacher blocks the student's view of the correct answer."
    ],
    "answer": "It's practicing a sequence of different skills in the same order every time, which doesn't build versatility.",
    "explanation": "In blocked practice...a drill is run over and over. A player moves from one station to the next...If you always practice the same skill in the same way...you’re starving your learning on short rations of variety."

  {
    "question": "According to the chapter, what is the problem with typical in-service training seminars for professionals that are compressed into a single weekend?",
    "options": [
      "They are a form of massed practice and most of the material will be forgotten.",
      "They are too expensive for most professionals to attend.",
      "They focus too much on interleaved practice.",
      "They are usually not long enough to cover the necessary material."
    ],
    "answer": "They are a form of massed practice and most of the material will be forgotten.",
    "explanation": "Continuing education seminars for professionals where training is condensed into a single weekend is an example of massed practice. The learning is not durable."
